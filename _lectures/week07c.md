# team04 - reflections

* Reflection is built into Agile in the retrospective
* But that should not be the only time we engage in reflection
* Reflection, in general is a useful habit
* To encourage you to build that habit, we have built a Slackbot that will prompt for reflection after every merged PR (or PR closed with being merged)

After each PR that is merged or closed, you'll be prompted in your team channel to enter a short reflection.

Your team's grade for team04 will be based on the quantity and quality of your reflections.

See: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s24/lab/team04.html> for details.

Here's an example of what that looks like "in the wild" (link to [post on slack](https://ucsb-cs156-s24.slack.com/archives/C06RP83BA83/p1715820746266849)).  This was a PR that the staff did to the
repo for <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-s24/proj-gauchoride-s24-5pm-5> to debug an issue with the workflow for updating issues, so the staff entered their own reflections as an example.

# Looking Ahead

* Release Notes (due end of week 10)
* Final Presentation (due end of week 10)

# Brief Discussion of "Release Notes"

At the end of the legacy code phase, each team will be required to submit "release notes" for all of the features they added to the main branch (i.e. the difference between their main branch, and the main branch of the starter code for the project.)

These serve at least two purposes:

* **Functional**: These messages help them to be aware of, and use the new functionality.  Customers can't take advantage of new features if they don't know about them.

* **Marketing**: If you are running a software business, you are always concerned about "churn", which is the business term for when a paying customer stops paying you, and starts giving money to your competitor instead.   These messages need to convey to your customers that you have heard their concerns, and care about making their lives easier, more fun, less stressfulâ€”whatever the purpose of the app happens to be.
As we move into the legacy code phase of the course over the next few days, **your PR descriptions will be the source material** for these release notes for either HappyCows or Gauchoride, so it's important that they be written well.  This is why we ask for screenshots, etc. and that the PR descriptions include a description of new features not just from the programmer/developer perspective, but from the end-user perspective.
