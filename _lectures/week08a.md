# Today

* Start with standup
* Review team Kanban board, and PR queue
* Make sure anything that needs a code review, has one.
* Work on issues, with help from the staff

# CATME PeerEval3

Please complete CATME PeerEval3 after class today, 
but before discussion tomorrow.

You'll be reminded during discussion tomorrow, but the survey closes 11:59pm Wednesday.

I want to release the results in time for students to look over them before the next Retro which may be as soon as Thursday.

# Looking Ahead

Wednesday 05/22 will be similar to today:
* Start with standup
* Review team Kanban board, and PR queue
* Make sure anything that needs a code review, has one.
* Work on issues, with help from the staff

For Thursday 05/24, you have a choice.  

* On Thursday 05/24, you can choose to:
  * do Retro3 in class (if all 6 team members are present and available.)
  * or defer Retro3
  
If you defer Retro 3, then Thursday looks just like Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, i.e. a normal work time.

You still have to do Retro3, and you have two options for when:

* OPTION 1 (OUTSIDE OF CLASS TIME): If the team *unanimously* chooses, with no objection, and everyone participating in the decision, to hold the retro outside of class time over zoom, you may do so, provide that:
  - You post the date/time on the slack, and everyone agrees to it
  - Everyone participates for the full length of the retro, which lasts at least 50 minutes
  - You make a video recording of the retro and upload it to your team Google Drive folder (in addition to the normal document)
  - The out of class retro takes place between {{site.retro3_ooc_window_opens}} and {{site.retro3_ooc_windows_closes}}

* OPTION 2 (TUESDAY OF WEEK 9): Hold the retro during class time on Tuesday 05/27.

If you don't have the retro done by Tuesday of Week 9, then you are obligated to spend class time that day on it.

Let me know if there are any questions about that.
