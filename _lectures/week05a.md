# Announcements

## Try to wrap up team02 OUTSIDE OF CLASS

Tomorrow in section, we'll be releasing team03, so try to wrap up team02 and submit on Canvas before then.

If you still need help with team02, we'll still be offering help on Wednesday and Thursday, but we strongly encourage you to wrap up team02 asap.

We want to start the legacy code projects by week 7, so we need to wrap up both team02 and team03 within week 5 (this week) and 6 (next week).


## Ten minute standup 5:01pm-5:11pm

* Do a written update on the slack channel
* Do an out loud standup
* When done with standup start reading about the retrospective process at the links below.

## Agile Retrospective Intro (5:11-5:20)

The agile retrospective today is a group participation assignment, P13 (on canvas here:  <{{page.canvas_retro_submission}}> )

The most important aspect of Agile is the **Retrospective**

We "inspect and adapt".

* Please pause all work/submission for team02.
* Focus only on the retro, and do not rush through it.
* A retro that lasts less than 30 minutes raises questions about whether it is a good faith effort.
* Give it the time that it needs.

# Where did Agile come from?

* The old Waterfall method didn't work well: <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_waterfall_model.htm>
* During the 90s, folks inspected and adapted, leading to the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

# Retrospective: the heart of Agile

The core principle of Agile is "inspect and adapt".
* It was "inspecting and adapting" that led the original authors of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) to their ideas.
* It has been by "inspecting and adapting" that the Agile philosophy continues to grow and develop.

Inspect and Adapt is, in many ways, linked to the *Scientific Method*;
* we observe
* we form a hypothesis
* we do an experiment

All in the service of doing a better job of software development.

In a retro, the team stops, pauses, reflects, and most importantly *comes up with an actionable change* for their practice.

# Today's Retro (5:20 - 5:55)

* Start by having everyone take 5 minutes to read through this article: [https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html)
  - Really read it!  It has the instructions for the most important activity in today's class

* Next, choose a leader for your retro. It should be someone that has read the instructions and is comfortable leading the group.
* Then, locate the Google Drive folder for your team.  It should be linked in your Slack channel with a `Google Drive` link this:

<img width="260" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-w24/team02-w24-7pm-3/assets/15284810/bbd9f7b7-ebf4-4411-a28b-bdf9fcaddbda">

Check that each member of the team is able to access the folder.

In that folder, there should be a document called `Retro1`.  Open this document.

Follow the instructions in the document.

At the end of the process, you should have in your document:
* Name of person leading the retro at the top
* Stop/start/continue posts copied from Slack for each team member (these should appear on slack also)
* Dot voting for which parts you will discuss
* Discussion notes for three items the team discussed
* A summary at the bottom on an "experiment" in the form "If we change X we hope to see Y result"
  - This should be related to one of the top three items by votes that your group agreed on.
* A brief explanation of how you will know whether your experiment was or was not a success.

# After the retro is done: Review and Submit on Canvas ({{page.retro_asn}})

* Ask a staff member to look over your GDrive document; they'll check it to make sure it has the required elements:
  - items from each member under start/stop/continue
  - dot voting
  - an experiment, including the criteria by which you can know whether the experiment was a success
* If/when they say LGTM, submit on Canvas here: <{{page.canvas_retro_submission}}>

# Next steps if there's more time

* Continue work on [team02](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/{{page.quarter}}/lab/team02.html)
* Work on homework assignment [{{page.js_hwk}}](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/{{page.quarter}}/hwk/{{page.js_hwk]}}/) (Intro to JavaScript).


### Staff use only

The information in the dropdown is for staff use only; you are welcome to look at it, but it's just
the details of what preparation needs to happen for today's lecture. Not all that interesting, unless you
want a peek behind the scenes.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>
Preparation for first retro
</summary>

* Create folder such as `cs156-f23-teams` inside staff Google Drive folder
* Create one folder per team inside that folder named `f23-9am-1`, `f23-9am-2`, etc.
* Create `retro1` document inside each of those folders
* Paste content inside each
* For each team slack channel, send this message:

  @channel One small thing to do before class today if possible (< 5 minutes)
  Please see the link labelled gdrive at the top of this channel.
  Please verify that when logged in with your UCSB Google account, that you can open this folder.
  You should see a document inside called `retro1.docx`.
  Inside that document, in Part 4, is a place for each team member to enter their name next
  to prompts: "Team member 1:  Name: _____________________________", etc.

  Find the first available blank, and enter your name. Go ahead and do that now.

  The order is unimportant; we just want each of the six team members to reserve a
  portion of the document for themselves.   The rest, you can do in class today.

  This will serve as a check that everyone has write access to this document before class today.
  If you have trouble, please post a note on the channel, and mention @phtcon
