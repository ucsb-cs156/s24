# Today
* Mini-lecture: what is a Scrum Master?

* Standup
  * Each team member, please do a written standup update in your slack channel.  You can do these updates at any time starting from now up until your scheduled section time.
  * Please meet in person or on zoom during the first 10 minutes of your scheduled discussion time (or at the very least, check in on Slack during those 10 minutes) to do two things:
    1. An out loud standup
    2. Scrum Master functions (is everyone assigned an issue? are issues moving across the board? has anything been "in review" for more than 24 hours without a code review?  Is anything ready to be merged?).
    3. Decide: do you want to have a dedicated scrum master for the rest of this sprint? Or do you want "the team" to be the Scrum Master?  *Record your decison in your slack channel in a pinned post.*

* Work on team03
