# If your team has NOT already completed Retro 3

Please devote the entire class period (or at least 50 minutes of it) to completing Retro3.

Please do not ask the staff any questions about your project today unless/until your Retro3 is complete, checked off by a staff member, and submitted on Canvas.

Submit by 6:15pm today at [Retro3]({{page.retro3_canvas}})

# If your team HAS completed Retro 3

Then, it's the usual thing:
* Start with standup
* Review team Kanban board, and PR queue
* Make sure anything that needs a code review, has one.
* Work on issues, with help from the staff
