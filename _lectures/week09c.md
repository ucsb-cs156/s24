Final Pull Requests for legacy code projects are due by 5pm today.

Each of those should be:
* green on CI
* code reviewed by a team member by 5pm today.

Any PRs not in that state by 5pm today *might not be reviewed and merged by staff* in time to count towards your project grade.

After 5pm today, typically the only work accepted for credit will be work necessary to get those remaining PRs merged (e.g. responding to peer and/or staff code reviews.)

* Exceptions to this are usually *initiated by the staff*, i.e. a team is *invited* to submit something to either fix a problem, or address some unusual circumstance that may have created an inequity in the process.
* Exceptions initiated by students are rarely approved; the default answer is to deny them, however they will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
* A key consideration in all cases is whether the student and/or team involved shows a track record of serious committment to finishing on time, and ran into circumstances beyond their control they could not reasonably have anticipated.

# If your team is already at 100 points

You can start on any of the following, which are your last three responsibilities *as a team*
* your team's Final Retro
* your team's Final Video Presentation
* your team's Release Notes

You can also read more about the:
* written asynchronous take home final exam on Gradescope
* final class meeting (which takes place during the scheduled final exam slot)

Note that synchronous participation in the final class meeting *is* required, but remote participation over zoom is totally fine.


# Final Retro

If your team is already at or above 100 points, and is not currently involved in helping to get things merged, you could start your final retro today. See below for details.
