# Announcements

## Homework assignment {{page.hwk}}

Homework assignment [{{page.hwk}}](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/{{page.quarter}}/hwk/{{page.hwk}}/) covers Javascript.

* This will provide a brief introduction to JavaScript before we start team03, coming soon, where we start to work with the frontend
* The due date is on Gradescope; but *it will be better if you get this done sooner rather than later* so that you are prepared
  for team03.
* So, please start on {{page.hwk}} as/when you are finishing up team02, or you are blocked, e.g.
  * waiting for office hours because you stuck on something
  * done with your PRs, and there's nothing currently to code review

  Or, if you just need a break from team02 work and want to do something else for a while

The point is, you'll find team03 much easier if you've had a chance to complete H02 first.


# Agenda

### Standup

- Do a written update on the slack channel
- Do an out loud standup
- When done with standup start reading about the retrospective process at the links below if you haven't done so yet.
- Then, work on team02


### Work on team02

* `team02` is due on Wednesday, May 1 at 11:59pm
* BUT: we are starting team03 that day, so please try to finish *before* then.

### Read up on the Retrospective Process

- [Agile Retros](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html)
