Today you have a choice:

* Either do Retro3 in class (if all 6 team members are present and available) and submit on Canvas at [Retro3]({{page.retro3_canvas}})
* OR Defer Retro3.
  
If you defer Retro 3, then today's work will be the usual:

* Start with standup
* Review team Kanban board, and PR queue
* Make sure anything that needs a code review, has one.
* Work on issues, with help from the staff

You still have to do Retro3, and you have two options for when:

* OPTION 1 (OUTSIDE OF CLASS TIME): The team may choose to do Retro3 outside of class time, which frees up class time to get help from the course staff.

But these conditions apply to this option:

  * The team must make a *unanimously* choice, with no objection, documented in the team slack channel, with everyone participating in the decision, to hold the retro outside of class time over zoom.
  * You must post the date/time on the slack team channel, and everyone must agree to it.
  * Everyone must participates for the full length of the retro, which lasts at least 50 minutes
  * You must make a video recording of the retro and upload it to your team Google Drive folder (in addition to the normal document)
  * The out of class retro must take place and be submitted on Canvas at [Retro3]({{page.retro3_canvas}}) between {{site.retro4_ooc_window_opens}} and {{site.retro4_ooc_windows_closes}}


* OPTION 2 (TUESDAY OF WEEK 9): Hold the retro during class time on Tuesday 05/27.

If you don't have the retro done by Tuesday of Week 9, then you are obligated to spend class time that day on it.

Let me know if there are any questions about that.
