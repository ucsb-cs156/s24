# Final Retro

The instructions for the final retro are in the usual place on the Google Drive (gdrive link on your slack channel).

Please look there for the retro4 worksheet.

This retro is a little different from the rest, in the sense that it is a sort of "exit interview" for the team.

There is no further work ahead of the team, so instead of focusing on how the team can improve, it is focused more on
what learnings from your time together you'll take with you to future work on team software development projects.

Other than that, it's like any other retro.

# Notes about the final retro

You have a choice when to schedule the Final Retro.

Your choices are:
* During class on 05/30 (Week 9 Thursday)
* During class on 06/04 (Week 10 Tuesday)
* During class on 06/05 (Week 10 Wednesday)
* During class on 06/06 (Week 10 Thursday)
* Or outside of class on zoom any time between {{site.retro4_ooc_window_opens}} and {{site.retro4_ooc_window_closes}}

If you choose the "outside of class option", then the same conditions apply as for the previous out of class retro:

* The team must make a *unanimously* choice, with no objection, documented in the team slack channel, with everyone participating in the decision, to hold the retro outside of class time over zoom.
* You must post the date/time on the slack team channel, and everyone must agree to it.
* Everyone must participates for the full length of the retro, which lasts at least 50 minutes
* You must make a video recording of the retro and upload it to your team Google Drive folder (in addition to the normal document)
* The out of class retro must take place between and be submitted on Canvas between {{site.retro4_ooc_window_opens}} and {{site.retro4_ooc_windows_closes}}
