# Final Class Meeting

The final class meeting will take place during the scheduled final exam slot for the course, which is:

* Wednesday, June 12, 2024 7:30 PM - 10:30 PM

Synchronous participation is required, however partcipation over zoom is fine.

 During the final course meeting, we typically complete an in-class assignment involving reviewing the videos, release notes, and implementations of the other teams in the course.

The reason we do this synchonrously is so that members of the various teams are available to consult with about the choices they made in their implementations, as well as available to fix any problems that may arise with the dokku deployments, etc.

So please be available on your slack channel, and either in person, or on zoom that day.
