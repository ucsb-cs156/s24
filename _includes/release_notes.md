# Brief Discussion of "Release Notes"

At the end of the legacy code phase, each team will be required to submit "release notes" for all of the features they added to the main branch (i.e. the difference between their main branch, and the main branch of the starter code for the project.)

These serve at least two purposes:

* **Functional**: These messages help them to be aware of, and use the new functionality.  Customers can't take advantage of new features if they don't know about them.

* **Marketing**: If you are running a software business, you are always concerned about "churn", which is the business term for when a paying customer stops paying you, and starts giving money to your competitor instead.   These messages need to convey to your customers that you have heard their concerns, and care about making their lives easier, more fun, less stressfulâ€”whatever the purpose of the app happens to be.
As we move into the legacy code phase of the course over the next few days, **your PR descriptions will be the source material** for these release notes for either HappyCows or Gauchoride, so it's important that they be written well.  This is why we ask for screenshots, etc. and that the PR descriptions include a description of new features not just from the programmer/developer perspective, but from the end-user perspective.

# Sample Release Notes

* courses: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-courses/blob/main/docs/release-notes/proj-courses-w24-5pm-2.pdf>
* happycows: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-happycows/blob/main/docs/release-notes/w24-4pm-2.pdf>
* organic: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-organic/blob/main/docs/release-notes/w24-6pm-1.pdf>
* gauchoride: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-gauchoride/blob/main/docs/release-notes/w24-7pm-1.pdf>

You are required to prepare a set of release notes as a team.

You may prepare these in one of two ways:
* As a Google Drive document in your Drive folder called `Release Notes` (in the same folder where your retros go), OR
* In Markdown format in a file `/docs/release_notes/team-name.md` (where `team-name` is, for example, `s24-5pm-1`) in a new branch of your repo called `release_notes`. If you choose this route, make a Pull Request for this change (the normal PR deadline doesn't apply to this PR).

The choice is up to you: each method has its pros and cons; do whatever seems easiest to you.

## What goes in the release notes

The release notes should summarize:
* For the actual *users* of the application, a summary of what changes they notice from the way the app was at the start of the course to now.
* In a separate, shorter section: for the *developers* of the application, a summary of any additional changes devs may need to be aware of.
* It does not have to be every single last detail of every change; it should focus on the big picture of things users/developers would need or want to know. 
* Before and after screenshots can be helpful.

## How to submit

Work colletively on this as a team.   When finished, submit a link to either your Google Drive doc, or to your PR on Canvas under the assignment `ReleaseNotes`

For the due date, refer to the Release Notes assignment on Canvas.
