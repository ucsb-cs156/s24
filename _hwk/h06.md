This homework grade is to complete your CATME peer evaluation by the published deadline.  Reminders were made:
* On Slack, multiple times
* In lecture on Tuesday, and Section on Wednesday
* By email from CATME, multiple times.

As with the previous peer evaluation, if you completed it, *including writing actual thoughtful comments about the work of each of your peers* you'll get a grade of 100/100.

As with the previous peer evaluation, If you completed it, but your comments are something generic that is copy and pasted 5 times like:

```
Alice is doing a great job!
Bob is doing a great job!
Charlene is doing a great job!
David is doing a great job!
Erica is doing a great job!
```

Then your grade will be at most 80/100 (i.e. a 20 point deduction for "phoning it in".)

Grades between 80 and 100 are at the instructors discretion based on the degree to which your feedback shows thoughtful consideration.

If you fail to complete it by the deadline, the grade will be
0/100 and cannot be made up.
