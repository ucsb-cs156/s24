During the legacy code phase of the project, whenever anyone on the team merges a PR or closes a PR, a slack bot will prompt you in your team channel for reflections.

When this happens, at least two people should write a brief reflection as a reply to the post by the slack bot:

* The developer that did most of the coding
* The team member that did the code erview

You should focus on **what you learned from working with this PR**, regardless of whether that learning took place as you thought about the issue,
wrote the code, debugged errors, wrote tests, dealt with CI/CD errors, dealt with the code review--in short, any phase of the software development lifecycle.

Sometimes, a PR may be very trivial, and as a result, there may not be much to say. *That's ok*, but you *should still at least make a post*.

There will be a team grade added to the lab portion of your grade that is based on two factors:

* 50% of your grade: What was the percentage of these prompts that were responded to (even if it was to say: this was a trival PR; there's not much to say)
* 50% of your grade: What was the overall quality of the team's reflections?  Here is where if you have "nothing to say" on 100% of your PRs, you may run into difficulties.  You should have some reflections on at least *some* of them!

If you have questions, please ask on the slack channel `#help-team04`
