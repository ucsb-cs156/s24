This homework assignment is designed to introduce you to the ideas of integration tests and end-to-end tests, as illustrated in this diagram, often called the "testing pyramid":

<img width="454" alt="testing pyramid" src="https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/ucsb-cs156.github.io/assets/1119017/cfbc9f96-af05-45de-bf54-bff7472a262a">

You can read more about the testing pyramid here:

* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/testing/testing_pyramid.html>

Briefly, the idea is that:
* Unit tests test only a *single unit*, so in principle,  *absolutely everything* outside that unit should be mocked (including network services, database calls, etc.)
* For an integration test, you are testing the integration of multiple units, so it's ok to *not* mock some parts of the interaction.  For example, an integration test of a controller might look *exactly like* the unit test of a controller, *except* that instead of mocking the database calls, you actually let the database calls happen to a real instance of the database (albeit one that is carefully controlled), and then you do assertions on the before and after state of the database tables.   
* For an end-to-end test, you treat the entire application (to the extent possible) as a "black box", meaning that the tests typically have no knowledge of "what's inside the box".   You use browser automation software to interact with an instance of a real browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.) and to act like a "robot" that is clicking buttons and entering data on real web pages, and then making assertions about the content of the page that shows up.  

A note about end-to-end tests: These can be done in two modes:

1.  "headless", where there is no real browser being rendered on a screen; it's all just simulated in memory.  This is the usual way of running end-to-end tests because its a lot faster.

2. "not headless" where the tester can actually watch all of the interactions happen on screen as the tests are being run. This is typically only used when developing or debugging the end-to-end tests.


In this homework exercise, you'll do five things, working in the team repo from team03.  While you are working in the team repo, this is an individual homework.

1. Run an existing integration test and look at the code.
2. Run an existing end-to-end test in headless mode (the normal way)
3. Run an existing end-to-end test in not headless mode (for development and debugging).
4. Develop an integration test of your own for *just one* of the controller methods from the controller you built during the team02 phase of the project that changes the database in some way (either create, update or delete; your choice).
5. Develop an end-to-end test for either create, update or delete for the user interface code you developed for a CRUD operations that changes the database (either create, update or delete, your choice).
6. Make a pull request containing these two tests.
7. Submit a link to the pull request on Canvas.
